    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents the implementation and evaluation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating Monet-style paintings. The project addresses the challenge of creating artificial artwork that captures the unique impressionist characteristics of Claude Monet's paintings. Through careful architecture design, data preprocessing, and training optimization, we successfully developed a model that can generate 8,000 high-quality 256x256 Monet-style images. The implementation shows the effectiveness of adversarial training in learning complex artistic styles and provides insights into the practical considerations of GAN training for artistic image creation.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to develop a generative model that can create artificial images that copy the unique artistic style of Claude Monet, the famous French impressionist painter. This work was conducted as part of the Kaggle \"I'm Something of a Painter Myself\" competition [6]. This problem belongs to the area of style transfer and artistic image generation, which has important applications in digital art, content creation, and cultural preservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Monet's impressionist style is characterized by loose brushwork, emphasis on light and its changing qualities, and vibrant color palettes. Traditional computer graphics approaches struggle to capture these detailed artistic elements, making deep learning-based generative models an attractive solution. The challenge is in training a model that can understand and reproduce the complex visual patterns, color relationships, and compositional elements that define Monet's artistic style.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Technical Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The main technical challenges include:\n",
    "- Learning complex artistic patterns from a limited dataset\n",
    "- Maintaining visual coherence while generating diverse outputs\n",
    "- Balancing the adversarial training dynamics between generator and discriminator\n",
    "- Preventing mode collapse in the artistic domain\n",
    "- Scaling generated images to meet submission requirements ($256 \\times 256$ pixels)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Dataset Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 300 high-quality digital reproductions of Monet paintings, stored in JPEG format within the `./data/monet/training/monet_jpg` directory [6]. This relatively small dataset size is typical for artistic style transfer tasks, where quality often matters more than quantity. The dataset was provided as part of the Kaggle \"I'm Something of a Painter Myself\" competition, which focuses on GAN-based artistic style transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Basic Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Images:** 300\n",
    "- **Format:** JPEG (.jpg)\n",
    "- **Batch Configuration:** 16 images per batch (18 complete batches, 12 images dropped due to `drop_last=True`)\n",
    "- **Source:** Curated collection of Monet paintings\n",
    "- **Quality:** High-resolution digital reproductions\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset size of 300 images presents both opportunities and challenges. While smaller than typical computer vision datasets, it is sufficient for capturing Monet's artistic patterns due to the consistency in his impressionist style. However, it requires careful regularization and augmentation strategies to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploratory data analysis revealed crucial insights that informed our preprocessing and model design decisions. The analysis encompassed six key areas: dataset basics, image properties, pixel distributions, color characteristics, sample visualizations, and quality metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Image Properties Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image Properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devmarkpro/dcgan-monet-style-kaggle/main/report_material/eda/image_properties.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image properties analysis revealed significant variation in the original dimensions of Monet paintings, which is expected given the diverse canvas sizes used by the artist throughout his career. This heterogeneity necessitated standardized preprocessing to ensure consistent input dimensions for the neural network. The file size distribution indicated high-quality source images, providing rich detail for the model to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Pixel Distribution Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pixel Distributions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devmarkpro/dcgan-monet-style-kaggle/main/report_material/eda/pixel_distributions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pixel distribution analysis provided insights into the color characteristics of Monet's work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Red Channel:** Mean $= 122.02$, Standard Deviation $= 52.45$\n",
    "- **Green Channel:** Mean $= 123.96$, Standard Deviation $= 50.06$  \n",
    "- **Blue Channel:** Mean $= 110.35$, Standard Deviation $= 54.61$\n",
    "\n",
    "These statistics reveal that Monet's paintings exhibit a slight bias toward warmer tones (higher red and green values) with the blue channel showing the highest variance, reflecting his diverse use of sky and water elements. The relatively balanced channel means suggest good color distribution across the spectrum, which is favorable for GAN training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Color Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "![Color Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devmarkpro/dcgan-monet-style-kaggle/main/report_material/eda/color_analysis.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The color analysis demonstrates the rich palette characteristic of impressionist work. Monet's paintings show high saturation in key areas while maintaining subtle gradations that create the signature impressionist effect. The brightness distribution indicates a preference for well-lit scenes, consistent with Monet's focus on capturing natural light conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Sample Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample Images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devmarkpro/dcgan-monet-style-kaggle/main/report_material/eda/sample_images.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample visualization shows both original and preprocessed versions of representative paintings. This comparison illustrates how our preprocessing pipeline maintains the essential artistic characteristics while standardizing the format for neural network input.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample Grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devmarkpro/dcgan-monet-style-kaggle/main/report_material/eda/sample_grid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample grid provides an overview of the dataset diversity, showcasing various subjects including landscapes, water scenes, and architectural elements that are hallmarks of Monet's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Quality Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "![Quality Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devmarkpro/dcgan-monet-style-kaggle/main/report_material/eda/quality_analysis.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality analysis revealed important characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sharpness:** Mean $= 166.23$, Standard Deviation $= 117.05$ (Range: $17.67 - 588.09$)\n",
    "- **Contrast:** Mean $= 45.04$, Standard Deviation $= 11.92$ (Range: $21.90 - 67.34$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The wide sharpness range reflects Monet's varied brushwork techniques, from soft, blended areas to more defined structural elements. The moderate contrast values are consistent with impressionist techniques that often favor subtle tonal variations over stark contrasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Preprocessing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the EDA findings, we implemented a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline that balances computational efficiency with artistic quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.transform = transforms.Compose([\n",
    "    transforms.Resize(64),\n",
    "    transforms.CenterCrop(64),\n",
    "    transforms.ToTensor(),\n",
    "    transforms.Normalize([0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]),\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Design Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resolution Reduction to $64 \\times 64$:**\n",
    "The decision to reduce image resolution from the original dimensions to $64 \\times 64$ pixels was based on several important factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computational Efficiency:** Training at full resolution ($256 \\times 256$ or higher) would require significantly more computational resources and training time\n",
    "2. **Training Stability:** Lower resolution reduces the complexity of the learning task, leading to more stable GAN training dynamics\n",
    "3. **Pattern Focus:** At $64 \\times 64$, the model focuses on essential artistic patterns and color relationships rather than fine details, which aligns well with impressionist aesthetics\n",
    "4. **Memory Constraints:** Enables efficient batch processing within available GPU memory, particularly important for Apple Silicon MPS backend\n",
    "\n",
    "**Center Cropping:**\n",
    "Center cropping ensures that the most important compositional elements are preserved while maintaining aspect ratio consistency across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalization Strategy:**\n",
    "The normalization to $[-1, 1]$ range using $[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]$ mean and standard deviation is chosen specifically for GAN training, as it matches the output range of the generator's tanh activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Post-Processing for Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "To meet the $256 \\times 256$ pixel requirement for final submission, we implemented a high-quality upscaling process using LANCZOS resampling, which preserves artistic details while scaling the generated $64 \\times 64$ images to the required dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Deep Learning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation follows the DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) architecture, which has proven effective for image generation tasks. The system consists of two competing neural networks: a generator that creates artificial images and a discriminator that tells the difference between real and generated images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Generator Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator network transforms random noise vectors into Monet-style images through a series of transposed convolutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Generator Architecture (64x64 output)\n",
    "nn.ConvTranspose2d(latent_size, ngf * 8, 4, 1, 0, bias=False)  # 1x1 -> 4x4\n",
    "nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 8, ngf * 4, 4, 2, 1, bias=False)     # 4x4 -> 8x8\n",
    "nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 4, ngf * 2, 4, 2, 1, bias=False)     # 8x8 -> 16x16\n",
    "nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 2, ngf, 4, 2, 1, bias=False)         # 16x16 -> 32x32\n",
    "nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf, 3, 4, 2, 1, bias=False)               # 32x32 -> 64x64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Design Elements:**\n",
    "- **Latent Vector Size:** 128 dimensions provide sufficient capacity for encoding artistic variations\n",
    "- **Feature Map Progression:** Follows the standard DCGAN pattern of halving feature maps while doubling spatial dimensions\n",
    "- **Activation Functions:** ReLU activations in hidden layers with Tanh output to match the $[-1, 1]$ normalized input range\n",
    "- **Batch Normalization:** Applied to all layers except the output to stabilize training\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator architecture is designed specifically to capture hierarchical artistic features, from basic color patterns in early layers to complex compositional elements in later layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actual Architecture Implementation:**\n",
    "Based on the training logs, the generator network consists of:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ConvTranspose2d(128, 512, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(1, 1))  # 1x1 -> 4x4\n",
    "ConvTranspose2d(512, 256, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2))  # 4x4 -> 8x8  \n",
    "ConvTranspose2d(256, 128, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2))  # 8x8 -> 16x16\n",
    "ConvTranspose2d(128, 64, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2))   # 16x16 -> 32x32\n",
    "ConvTranspose2d(64, 3, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2))    # 32x32 -> 64x64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This progressive upsampling allows the network to build artistic features step by step, starting with basic color and texture patterns and gradually adding more complex compositional elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Discriminator Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminator works as a binary classifier that learns to tell the difference between authentic Monet paintings and generated images:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Discriminator Architecture (64x64 input)\n",
    "nn.Conv2d(3, ndf, 4, 2, 1, bias=False)           # 64x64 -> 32x32\n",
    "nn.Conv2d(ndf, ndf * 2, 4, 2, 1, bias=False)     # 32x32 -> 16x16\n",
    "nn.Conv2d(ndf * 2, ndf * 4, 4, 2, 1, bias=False) # 16x16 -> 8x8\n",
    "nn.Conv2d(ndf * 4, ndf * 8, 4, 2, 1, bias=False) # 8x8 -> 4x4\n",
    "nn.Conv2d(ndf * 8, 1, 4, 1, 0, bias=False)       # 4x4 -> 1x1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Design Elements:**\n",
    "- **Strided Convolutions:** Reduce spatial dimensions while increasing feature depth\n",
    "- **LeakyReLU Activations:** Prevent gradient vanishing and allow small negative values\n",
    "- **No Batch Normalization in First Layer:** Preserves input image statistics\n",
    "- **Sigmoid Output:** Produces probability scores for real/fake classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actual Architecture Implementation:**\n",
    "From the training logs, the discriminator network structure is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2))    # 64x64 -> 32x32\n",
    "Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2))   # 32x32 -> 16x16\n",
    "Conv2d(128, 256, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2))  # 16x16 -> 8x8\n",
    "Conv2d(256, 512, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2))  # 8x8 -> 4x4\n",
    "Conv2d(512, 1, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(1, 1))   # 4x4 -> 1x1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture effectively learns to tell the difference between authentic Monet paintings and generated images by progressively extracting features at multiple scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Training Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "The DCGAN training process involves alternating optimization of the generator and discriminator networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discriminator Training:**\n",
    "1. Train on real Monet images (target: 1)\n",
    "2. Train on generated images (target: 0)\n",
    "3. Backpropagate combined loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generator Training:**\n",
    "1. Generate images from random noise\n",
    "2. Pass through discriminator (target: 1)\n",
    "3. Backpropagate generator loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Functions:**\n",
    "- **Discriminator Loss:** Binary cross-entropy on real and fake image classifications\n",
    "- **Generator Loss:** Binary cross-entropy encouraging discriminator to classify generated images as real\n",
    "\n",
